In both levels you can also adjust the volume of the BGM and the effects volums.

Also, you have the ability to pause the game.

You will have to use W and S key to maneuver the arrow. When you arrive at the desired choice, press enter. You will be sent back to the main menu if you choose quit. Otherwise you will continue the game.

A and D is for left and right while space is for jump.

The game can be played with/without user login. If you log in, the remaining life and total amount of gold will be recorded into the database. The amount of coins will always be reset if your life count hits zero.

## Level 1 
The 1 level is a basic level inspired from the original 1 level of the mario bros game.![](https://i.imgur.com/Pbz9ONC.png)

There are two different enemies, The piranha flower and the turtle. There are two kinds of piranha flowers. Some will already be risen and stand in the middle of the road while others rise from the tubes. There are also turtles. The turtles can be killed when contacted from above. After that, the player could send the turtle shell flying with another touch and stop it when contacted from above.

If you encounter an enemy and get attacked, you will be bounced back for a certain distance. HOWEVER, <font color="#f00">YOU DON'T HAVE IMMUNITY</font> in this period of time. I designed some enemies to trigger each other when you touch one of the two. 

The question box will have a 90% chance to generate a coin and a 10% chance to generate mushroom. The coin will automatically be collected as you will see it appear after you bump the box and then dissapear.

## LEVEL 2

Level 2 is constructed with falling blocks. You will be able to jump on the blocks once. After contact, the block will fall and then disappear. 
There are piranha flowers and turtles to stop you. <font color="#f00">There is a great chance that you will be launched to death if you touch either one of the multiple enemies </font>

## Special ability
There is a special ability "Air jump" that the mario has. If the mario is coming off a higher platform than the floor, while he did not jump off the platform, he can perform and airjump midair. This will make the second level much more easier to get through.
